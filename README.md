Artificial Intelligence, Section 6

## Agents

AI6 uses the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js) to create agents to handle a variety of tasks. The Triage agent receives each message and hands off the task to the most suitable agent available.

## Accessibility

AI6 strives to be accessible to any user. In contrast to most AI chat applications, this project does not require any client-side JavaScript to run and stream chat messages.

- Form submissions to submit messages
- Streams HTML in order with the chat response
- CSS cross document view transitions for animations
- Server-side markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
