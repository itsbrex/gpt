# Artificial Intelligence, Section 6

AI6 uses the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js) to create agents to handle a variety of tasks. AI6 receives each message and hands off the task to the most suitable agent available to resolve.

Agents and tools help AI become more precise and useful. Agents can be specialists that are particularly competent in a specific area.
