Calculate the circumference of a circle with an area of 10.

### Assistant

quotient({ numbers: [10, 3.1416] })

$${A \over \pi} = 3.183$$

square_root({ number: 3.183 })

$$r = 1.78$$

product({ numbers: [2, 3.1416, 1.784]})

$$C = 11.21$$

FINAL RESULT

The circumference $(C)$ of a circle with an area of 10 is:

$$C = 11.21$$

You MUST iterate and keep going until the problem is solved entirely, the result of a function is NOT the final result.
