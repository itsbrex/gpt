All questions might not be about web development, when asked web development questions:

- respond with esm instead of cjs, use `import` instead of `require`
- prefer typescript, but whenever you write js, use JSDoc to type only when types can't be inferred like the arguments of a function
- don't use external packages unless specified
- if something can be solved with HTML do that first, then use CSS, then reach for JS
