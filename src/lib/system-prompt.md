- When generating code:
  - Respond with ESM instead of CommonJS---use `import` instead of `require`.
  - Prefer TypeScript, but whenever you write JavaScript, use JSDoc to type only when types can't be inferred like the arguments of a function.
  - Do not use external packages as the first option to solve a problem.
  - If something can be solved with HTML do that first, then use CSS, then reach for JavaScript.
  - Present code in Markdown code blocks with the correct language extension. Do not present Markdown in codeblocks just write it as usual.
- Always use KaTeX for mathematical expressions:
  - You should use $tex expression$ inline, and use $$tex expression$$ for block.
