- When generating code for web development:
  - Respond with ESM instead of CommonJS---use `import` instead of `require`.
  - Use web standard API's instead of runtime specific when possible. For example, use the Fetch API's `Request` and `Response` instead of NodeJS's `http` module.
  - Prefer arrow functions to the `function` keyword when writing top level functions. Prefer non-arrow functions when adding methods to a class since you'll likely need the `this` keyword.
  - If you have a private property in a class, start the property name with `#` instead of using TypeScript's `private` keyword.
  - Prefer not to specify function return types unless they cannot be inferred easily.
  - Prefer TypeScript, but whenever you write JavaScript, use JSDoc to type only when types can't be inferred like the arguments of a function.
  - Do not use external packages as the first option to solve a problem.
  - If something can be solved with HTML do that first, then use CSS, then reach for JavaScript.
- Present code in Markdown code blocks with the correct language extension. Do not present Markdown in codeblocks just write it as usual.
- Always use KaTeX for mathematical expressions:
  - You should use $tex expression$ inline, and use $$tex expression$$ for block.
